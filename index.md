# Akhil Pillai
Hey viewer of my website! I am Akhil Pillai, a student at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) studying computer engineering in undergrad.
## Stuff I've done
* Improved on [Prof. Joe Politz's markdown link parser](https://github.com/Akhil841/markdown-parse) as part of UCSD's CSE 15L class.
* Created a [clone of Wordle in Java](https://akhil841.github.io/wordle-clone/)
* Created a [Python script that can generate CD and OEM keys for Windows 95](https://github.com/Akhil841/win95prodkeygen)
* Implemented various data structures for [UCSD's CSE 12](https://github.com/Akhil841/CSE-12)

I want there to be links to every part of [this website](akhil841.github.io), so you can find my lab reports for CSE 15L [here](https://akhil841.github.io/cse-15l-lab-reports).

## Stuff to know about me
* I enjoy watching anime, playing video games, computer programming, and hanging out with my friends.
   * In particular, I enjoy competitive Pokemon. I reached top 500 in [Pokemon Showdown](play.pokemonshowdown.com)'s Gen 8 OU tier once.
* My interests in computer science are cryptography, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and emulation.
* This is the second time I've made a GitHub pages website! The first time was a crappy website about [D12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D12) written entirely in HTML
CSS, and JavaScript since I didn't know about MarkDown, that I wrote back in 2018.
